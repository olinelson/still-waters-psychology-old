        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
          Engaging in research continues to be an important aspect of my
          professional life. Currently I am a Senior Research Fellow with the
          Lumen Research Institute (2017-2020). Previously I have held various
          formal and adjunct Research Fellow positions (e.g., Griffith
          University (2011-2012); Central Queensland University (2009-2010);
          University of Western Sydney (2008)). As a researcher I continue to
          participate in research collaborations with a range of academic and
          clinical institutions (e.g., Children’s Hospital at Westmead; Brain
          and Mind Centre). My own research is focused on spirituality and
          psychological health; the experiences of those with disability and
          serious illness and their carers’ needs; sense-making in the context
          of trauma and loss; and health practitioner professional formation. My
          research has been published in peer-reviewed journals and book
          chapters also presenting work at national and international
          conferences (See below)
