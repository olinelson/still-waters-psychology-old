            <p>
              We respect that your time is valuable, and we appreciate that you
              understand ours is too. Regretfully cancellation fees are
              necessary as it unlikely that your spot can be given to another
              client at such short note.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A 60% cancellation fee will be applied when clients cancel
                within 24 hours of their appointment.
              </li>
              <li>
                A 40% cancellation fee will be applied when clients cancel
                within 48 hours of their appointment.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When cancelling a session, please advise as to the reason for the
              cancellation. Please note Medicare do not reimburse cancelled
              fees, while the NDIA cover a limited number of cancellation fees.
              If you have concerns about this policy, please discuss them with
              your therapist.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are rare occasions when, with regret, your therapist needs
              to cancel a session due to unexpected circumstances. Where this
              occurs, you will be offered a replacement appointment at a
              mutually convenient time, at the normal session fee. We apologise
              for any inconvenience arising from these rare occasions.
