        <h4>Late Arrival Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Where clients arrive late for a session, the session will still end at
          the scheduled time, meaning that session will be shorter on that
          occasion.Â Time has been reserved for you and only you at the agreed
          upon time, with other people are scheduled after your time.
        </p>

        <h4>No Show Policy</h4>
        <p>
          Where clients fail to attend an appointment and there is no
          communication regarding their absence the normal session fee will be
          applied.
        </p>

        <h4>Cancellation policy</h4>
        <p>
          We respect that your time is valuable, and we appreciate that you
          understand ours is too. Regretfully cancellation fees are necessary as
          it unlikely that your spot can be given to another client at such
          short note.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A 60% cancellation fee will be applied when clients cancel within 24
            hours of their appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 40% cancellation fee will be applied when clients cancel within 48
            hours of their appointment.{" "}
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When cancelling a session please advise as to the reason for the
          cancellation. Please note Medicare do not reimburse cancelled session
          and the NDIS cover a limited number of cancellation fees.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          Where a therapist needs to cancel for unexpected reasons you will be
          offered a replacement appointment at a mutually convenient time at the
          normal session fee.
